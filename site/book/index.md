# Story

When a structure changes, everything under that structure also changes.

This includes language itself, and contracts in all their many forms, and of course the meanings of the various ideas about intelligence.

Constants from the old story, to be taken into the new, yet to be written story

## An erosion of Maslow's hierarchy of needs has been underway.

1. Physiological needs (food, water, shelter, rest)
2. Safety needs (security, stability, freedom from fear)
3. Social and belonging needs (friendship, intimacy, acceptance)
4. Esteem needs (respect, recognition, status)
5. Self-actualisation needs (achieving one's full potential, creativity)
